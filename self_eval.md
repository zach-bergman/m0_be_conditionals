# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    - It is useful to use conditional statements when I need to compare different values of data types or variables, in order to return boolean values for the following code to execute in a logical way.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    - If I did this assignment over, I would do more research into conditional statements/if statements, and see if there are
    betters ways to write them. Maybe ways that take up less lines and are more efficient.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    -  The most satisfaction came from working through the code challenges, writing out the code for the if statements, and thinking through the logic. I also enjoyed explaining what each line of code does in the comparisons.rb file, it really made think about what each piece of code is, and what it does.
